# Minesweeper-server-client

The development of a version of Minesweeper that allows interaction between two remote computers. The main goal of this project is to create both a server and a client that enable Minesweeper gameplay at a distance. The server is responsible for maintaining and updating the current state of the game, while the client's role is to send the chosen field coordinates and receive updated information from the server about the game state.
